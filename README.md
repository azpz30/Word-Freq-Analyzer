# Word-Freq-Analyzer
Experience lightning-fast performance with this high-speed Text Analytics Toolkit in C, powered by custom Binary Search Trees. Despite dynamic word storage, the algorithm achieves an impressive O(n) time complexity, where 'n' corresponds to the total number of words processed.

**Description:**
The Word Frequency Analyzer is a personal project I developed as part of my Data Structures and Algorithms course. In the rapidly growing field of data analytics, text analytics plays a pivotal role. This project focuses on extracting a key text analytics metric: the frequency of occurrence of the most common words in a text document.

To achieve this, I designed a program that can process text documents sourced from Project Gutenberg, a renowned initiative that digitizes out-of-copyright books and makes them freely accessible. These documents include literary classics like "Moby Dick" and are provided in a simple, resilient ASCII text format.

The project involves several essential steps:

**1. Preprocessing:** Text analysis requires some preprocessing steps:
   - Tokenization and normalization: Identifying individual words and converting them to lowercase.
   - Stopword removal: Eliminating common words that don't contribute significantly to document semantics.
   - Stemming: Reducing words to their root form to remove variations.

**2. Implementation of the Dictionary ADT:** I created a binary search tree-based Dictionary ADT to store words and their occurrence counts efficiently.

**3. Efficient Computation:** The program is designed for efficiency, with the ability to process large data files in under a second.

**4. Error Handling:** Robust error handling ensures that the program gracefully handles various error scenarios, such as incorrect command-line arguments or unreadable files.

**5. Testing and Debugging:** Thorough testing using provided data files and custom test cases, along with debugging techniques, ensures the program's correctness and reliability.

**6. GitHub Repository:** You can find the complete source code and documentation for this project in my GitHub repository.

This project showcases my skills in data structures, algorithms, and software development, highlighting my ability to work with real-world data and create efficient and error-tolerant solutions. It's a testament to my dedication to mastering key concepts in computer science and applying them to practical challenges.

Feel free to explore the repository to see the code, documentation, and results of various test cases. I am proud of this project, as it represents my commitment to excellence in software development and my passion for tackling complex problems in the world of data analytics.
